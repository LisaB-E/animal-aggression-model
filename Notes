                     model discussion points
=================================================================

 1.  Order of things... multiple feeding events - doesn't make sense 
    keep habitat the same  in each
    change to binary - food resource or not, clumped vs not, feeding only when succesfyl comp

 3. Intra vs inter?
    comp is random across everyone
    transient vs intransient
 4. 

sensitivity - clumped, to, evenly spaced habitat? Point process.  edge movements.

on their own - full access
other individual - share resource proportionally to number. or maybe all get one? resoucre limoited vs not? plus random allocation.
read more for IBM3 - optimal foraging theory vs gamne theory? changing strategies?

REMEMBER - giraffes. if we generate a model after theory, what would happen? emergent properties at scale

list of comp/aggresion
given this theory ating on indiv scale, ability to scale up to community levels


NEW:


Move:    
- a single movement step per generation? is that realistic? does it matter?

Fight: 
- should be option to not fight when low energy?
- losers do not feed? reproduce? Maybe better to let everythign be energy dependent? Rather than winner vs loser dependent?

Reproduction:
- offspring start in parent cell - wait does that then trigger higher risk for competition?!


Meeting November '21

- Figure out parallel computing, using multiple cores, or HPC to run final simulation
- DONE - Change to timesteps, not generations
- DONE - Make reproduction more rare, every x timestep
- DONE - Reinitiate haibaitat too every time
- Change sp. diversity/abundance figs to show all reps, not mean
- DONE - Add feeding to model
- Figure out habitat clustering, use empirical data if possible, sensitivity test
- Initialise with same SAD as empirical data
- Add habitat quality influencing aggresison factor
- ration of energies, feed vs fight vs aggresion vs repordutcon etc --> energy budgets!
- repro should be limited for low energy individuals...
- moving should have cost too?
- figure out saving subset of data t avoid bloat
- figure out way to track births & deaths
- increase reproduction
- die of old age?
