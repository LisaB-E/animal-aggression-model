                     model discussion points
=================================================================

 1.  Order of things... multiple feeding events - doesn't make sense 
    keep habitat the same  in each
    change to binary - food resource or not, clumped vs not, feeding only when succesfyl comp
    
 2.  Option to not move - even if not habitat related?
    move in four directions - completely random
    read up on edge stuff more
 3. Intra vs inter?
    comp is random across everyone
    transient vs intransient
 4. 

sensitivity - clumped, to, evenly spaced habitat? Point process.  edge movements.

on their own - full access
other individual - share resource proportionally to number. or maybe all get one? resoucre limoited vs not? plus random allocation.
read more for IBM3 - optimal foraging theory vs gamne theory? changing strategies?

REMEMBER - giraffes. if we generate a model after theory, what would happen? emergent properties at scale

list of comp/aggresion
given this theory ating on indiv scale, ability to scale up to community levels
